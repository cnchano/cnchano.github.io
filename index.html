<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Charles Chano, a proud Mexican-American originally from the greater Los Angeles area, California, USA. Fluent in both Spanish and English, I seamlessly integrate my linguistic versatility into my career.</p>
<p>I recently graduated with a Master's degree in Robotics Engineering from Warsaw University of Technology, Warsaw, Poland. Having fallen in love with the European lifestyle and diversity, I'm keen on pursuing opportunities within the EU.</p>
<p>My career journey has equipped me with a robust background in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/project-tag-page.html#automotive" target="_blank">automotive</a> powertrain development and quality control for <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pages/project-tag-page.html#aerospace" target="_blank">aerospace</a> manufacturing. I've consistently aimed to leverage my interdisciplinary knowledge, blending mechanics with electrical and computer science.</p>
<p>I've hond my skills with projects ranging from my <a href="{{ bachelor_thesis_post.url | relative_url }}" target="_blank">Bachelor's thesis on the 2017 Baja SAE project car's transmission</a> to implementing <a href="{{ conform_auto_post.url | relative_url }}" target="_blank">automation in the inspection process at RBC.</a> 
  Most recently, I applied my knowledge from my Master's program, including A.I., mechanical dynamic modeling, and real-time systems, to <a href="{{ master_thesis_post.url | relative_url }}" target="_blank">develop a simulation of decentralized UAV formation for task completion.</a> </p>
<p>In my professional achievements, I've optimized workflows, enhanced product and system quality, and ensured maintainability. My decision-making process is rooted in data-driven insights and past experiences, enabling me to successfully implement impactful changes.</p>
<p>I take pride in my commitment to making improvements that benefit everyone involved.</p>

<!-- <h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>
  Hello, I'm Charles Chano, born and raised in the greater Los Angeles area (California, USA), where I've garnered the majority of my education and professional experience.
</p>
<p> 
  As a proud Mexican-American, I possess fluency in both Spanish and English, seamlessly integrating this linguistic versatility into my career.
</p>
<p>
  I am now a recent Robotics Engineer M.S. graduate from Warsaw University of Technology (Warsaw, Poland). 
  I grew to love the lifestyle of Europe, meeting people with all sorts of backgrounds, therefore I look to stay in the EU.
</p>
<p>
  In my career, I have developed a solid background in quality control for aerospace manufacturing and automotive powertrain development. 
</p>
<p>
  I have consistently aimed my career focus to leverage my interdisciplinary knowledge of mechanics with electrical and computer science. 
  From my bachelors thesis, where I focused on the electrical, programming, and mechanics of the transmission of the 2017 Baja SAE project car, to
  my professional experience where I implemented automation into the inspection process at RBC. Most recently, I took what I have learned during 
  my masters program (A.I., Mechanical dynamic modeling, real time systems) and applied it to my thesis, in addition to my prior experience, 
  where I developed a simulation of decentralized formation of UAV to complete a task. 
</p>
<p>
  In my professional achievements, I have optimized workflows, elevated the overall quality of products and systems, all while ensuring maintainability. 
  My decision-making process is rooted in data-driven insights and past experiences, 
  enabling me to successfully implement impactful changes. 
</p>
<p>
  I take pride in my commitment to making improvements that benefit everyone involved.
