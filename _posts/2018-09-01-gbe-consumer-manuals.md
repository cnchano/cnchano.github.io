    <h3> About Gale Banks Engineering: </h3>
    <p>
        Gale Banks Engineering is the engineering company behind <a href="https://official.bankspower.com/about-banks-power/" target="_blank">Banks Power.</a> Banks Power is known far and wide as the premier designer and manufacturer of power-enhancing products for diesel- and gas-powered light trucks, motorhomes, and sport-utility vehicles. </p>
    <p>
        With the goal of increaing power, multiple products employ various methods to get the most out of the vehicle's engine, from in line tuners to size increases in cold air intakes. All products are validated and benchmarked against competition to prove their product's capability to consumers. 
    </p>

<p>
As a test technician, I came into the company in the middle of the Derringer in-line tuner's application development. The company's goal was to make an easy to install in-line tuner for various engine models, by intercepting signals to and from the ECU, resulting in a greater power output capacity by the engine. After ensuring that the tuner integrates with an engine model, functionality is tested with each vehicle model.
</p>
<p>
After recieving a new vehicle, I created a prototype wiring harness routing from the ideal location for the Derringer Tuner to the FRP and MAP/TMAP sensors. At this point, any issues in the installation were troubleshot with the guidance of the developers of the Derringer Tuner software.
</p>
<p>
Finally I would test the tuner system on the dyno, capturing data results for the development team to determine if the results were satisfactory.
</p>
<p>
Additional to testing, all steps taken in the installation process I documented for our commercial user manuals. Working with the media department, I communicated all the technical documentation of the installation, and ensured clarity of the conveyed information. To decrease time in editing, I personally took charge in learning the editing software to decrease editing time by up to 50% and improve the technical clarity of the installation manual.
